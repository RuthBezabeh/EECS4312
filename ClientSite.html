  <p> <i><b>Project Name:</b></i> SmartStock -Smart Retail Inventory Management System </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> <i><b>Project Description:</b></i> Retail businesses, regardless of their size, face the ongoing challenge of
    effectively managing their inventory.The traditional manual inventory management processes are
    time-consuming, error-prone, and often result in overstocking or understocking of products. 
    This inefficiency can lead to increased operational costs, lost sales opportunities, and dissatisfied customers.
    To address these issues, there is a pressing need for a smart retail inventory management system that leverages technology to 
    automate inventory tracking, predict demand, and optimize stock levels.
</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><i><b> Requirements:</b></i>
    <ol>
     <li> <b>Automate Inventory Tracking:</b> Develop a system that utilizes smart technology to automate the tracking of inventory items. 
       This should include real-time updates on the inventory in stores and in the warehouse as items are sold, stocked and returned.</li>    
     <li> <b>Optimize Stock Levels:</b> Develop a system that utilizes demand prediction and historical data to optimize stock levels
       by preventing overstocking and understocking. Ensure that the system should create new reorder quantities that needs manager approval
       before being sent to suppliers.</li> 
     <li><b>Real-time Visibility:</b> Develop a system that provides store managers, inventory clerks, and other authorized users with real-time
       visibility into the inventory levels and item locations. This includes easy access to stock status, sales trends, and product information.</li>    
     <li> <b> User Friendly Interface:</b> Design a user-friendly interface that caters to the needs of different users, including store managers,
       store clerks. Ensure ease of use and accessibility. Have admin access for store managers who can manually adjust the inventory. </li> 
     <li> <b>Security and Data Integrity:</b> Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive inventory data and ensure data integrity.
       This can be done by assigning roles for the users.</li>    
     <li><b>Alerts and Notifications:</b> Implement an alerting system that notifies users when inventory levels are critically low or
       when there are anomalies, such as discrepancies between physical counts and system records. </li> 
     
    </ol>
